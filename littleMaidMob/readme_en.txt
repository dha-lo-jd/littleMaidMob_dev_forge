Little Maid Mob 1.1.0 Rev2

This mod for minecraft is based on the character designed by
Mr. >>92 at "Minecraft Texture/MOD general.0.0.3" thread in 2ch PCgames board,
and I adjusted Rana model data.
The Little maid mob "screams" very cute voice by default.
And this MOD contains maid textures drawn by >>473,>>484,>>509 in
"Minecraft Texture/MOD general.0.0.4" thread.

Earlier versions of this MOD was modification of kodachi & Mr.30 designed 
Rana based MOD, but now, it has became almost solitary product. 
I added their functions one and after another, so this MOD is very "buggy".
Make frequent backup is recommended.
In case you encounterd bugs, please report them to the 2ch threads or japanese minecraft forums.

Elements of little maid mob

 -Contraction
 You can tame wild maids like wolves.
 Hold cake and right click, then they became contracted.
 The contracted maid is dressed herself with white brim (hair accessory).
 -Maids are tidy mobs !
 The maid mobs collect dropped items.
 -Maids are made of sugar, cocoa and something amorphous.
 Drop items has been changed.
 -Maids skirt are full of dreams.
 Maid inventory (named "inside skirt") is open when you right click 
 the contracted maid without special items (sugar, feather or something).
 -Give me Sugar !
 When you hold the sugar, maids come across to you and ask you to give it.
 Each time you give her sugar, her waiting mode and activated mode is switched.
 When some certain items are placed at the left upper slot of maid inventory,
 the maid changed into special activated mode (see below). 
 In addition, 0.5 heart recovers per 1 sugar.

 --Wings for freedom
 When you give the feather maids by right click, maids turns into freedom mode,
 and walk around about +/-10 block square, and if she has got away from the start
 point 17 blocks, she teleports to the start point.
 --Handmade dish by maids

 in the upper left slot of maid inventory, and activate her, 
 maids changes to the "Cooking" mode.
 When she find furnace, she start to smelting items inside her skirt.
 --Axes are weapon for maids.
 When you set the weapon entities (swords and axes) or healing items in the
 upper left slot of maid inventory, and activate her, they turn into 
 certain fighting mode ("Fencer", "Bloodsucker" and "Healer").
 --Now, it's time to rip.
 When you set the shears in the upper left slot of maid inventory, 
 and activate her, she changes into the "Ripper" and rip the wool of sheep.

 -Contraction needs consideration
 Contraction period is 7 days in the game, and 1 sugar let you extend another 7 days.
 If you place the sugars in the maid inventory, the contraction periods are automatically extended.
 When you forgot her salary, maid gets into strike, until you give her another cake once more. 
 Maid in strike remains and never despawn.
